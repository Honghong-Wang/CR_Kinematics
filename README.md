# SoftRobotics_Kinematics
I have done ForwardKinematics of Soft robot having 20th sections.
SGR- Soft growing Robot

task1_final.m is the MATLAB file which generates the workspace of SGR of having 30th section of robot
the video of workspace generation is "SGR_Bending_Demonstration_6stages.avi".
the workspace shown in figure "workspace_SGR_complete.jpg"

task2.m is the MATLAB file which generates the workspace of SGR of having 30th section, 
but with the decreasiing in the section from 30th to 10th section.
the workspace of decreasing section is shown in figure "section_workspace.jpg"

task3.m is to combine the task1_final.m and task2.m, the purpose of the task3.m is to generate complete
workspace for 30th section, then complete workspace for 29th section, then complete workspace for 28th secton 
and so on.....

the complerworkspace of  task3 is shown in figure "workspace.PNG", "untitled.jpg"
